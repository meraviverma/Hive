Hive Tables
------------------
Hive has two types of tables:
Managed table:
----------------
->Managed table is also called as Internal table.
->This is the default table in Hive. 
->By default, the table data will be created in /usr/hive/warehouse directory of HDFS.
->If we delete a Managed table, both the table data and meta data for that table will be deleted from the HDFS.

create table employee(Name String, Sal Int) row format delimited fields terminated by ',';

load data local inpath '/home/hduser/data.txt' into table employee;


External Table:
----------------
External table is created for external use as when the data is used outside Hive. Whenever we want to delete the
table’s meta data and we want to keep the table’s data as it is, we use External table. 
External table only deletes the schema of the table.

create external table employee(Name String, Sal Int) row format delimited fields terminated by ',';

Q> what is partitioning in hive?
------------------------------------
Ans: Classification of partitioning:

Static partitioning
Dynamic partitioning.


-Each partition is associated with with a folder in HDFS.
-All partition have a entry in the Hive Catatlog.
hive optimizer will parse the query for filter condititon.
Note: Columns which are a part of partitioner columns are not included in table definitions.
