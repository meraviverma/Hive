Q) What is Explode and Lateral View in Hive?
-----------------------------------------------
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+LateralView

Lateral view is used in conjunction with user-defined table generating functions such as explode().UDTF generates zero or more output 
rows for each input row. A lateral view first applies the UDTF to each row of base table and then joins 
resulting output rows to the input rows to form a virtual table having the supplied table alias.

A lateral view with explode() can be used to convert adid_list into separate rows using the query:

Page_id			adid_list
front_page		[1, 2, 3]
contact_page	[3, 4, 5]

SELECT pageid, adid
FROM pageAds LATERAL VIEW explode(adid_list) adTable AS adid;

Page_id         adid_list
"front_page"	    1
"front_page"	    2
"front_page"	    3
"contact_page"	  3
"contact_page"	  4
"contact_page"	  5


LATERAL VIEW clauses are applied in the order that they appear.

SELECT myCol1, col2 FROM baseTable
LATERAL VIEW explode(col1) myTable1 AS myCol1;

SELECT myCol1, myCol2 FROM baseTable
LATERAL VIEW explode(col1) myTable1 AS myCol1
LATERAL VIEW explode(col2) myTable2 AS myCol2;

To include null value use outer:
SELECT * FROM src LATERAL VIEW OUTER explode(array()) C AS a limit 10
